# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Repo Is

A documentation site (MkDocs Material) for a step-by-step guide to deploying Django on GCP using Terraform. The guide covers:

- **Cloud Run** (serverless containers)
- **PlanetScale** (serverless Postgres — set up manually, not via Terraform)
- **Cloud Storage** (media & static files)
- **Secret Manager** (secure credentials)
- **Artifact Registry** (private Docker images)
- **Cloud Tasks** (background job scheduling)
- **GitHub Actions** (CI/CD pipeline)
- **Workload Identity Federation** (keyless auth)

The Python code here is tooling to manage the docs, not a Django app itself.

## Commands

This project uses `uv` for dependency management (Python 3.14).

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv venv
uv pip install mkdocs-material mkdocs-static-i18n

# Serve docs locally with live reload
uv run mkdocs serve

# Build static site
uv run mkdocs build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages (CI does this automatically on push to main)
uv run mkdocs gh-deploy --force
```

## Architecture

- `docs/` — Markdown source files (chapters `01_introduction.md` … `19_quick_reference.md`) plus `index.md`; GCP + PlanetScale + Terraform
- `docs/*.es.md` — Spanish translations of docs/ (suffix convention — do not edit manually)
- `mkdocs.yml` — Site config: navigation order, i18n plugin (suffix strategy), Material theme, markdown extensions
- `overrides/main.html` — Custom Material theme template override
- `.github/workflows/docs.yml` — CI: installs deps with uv, runs `mkdocs gh-deploy` on every push to `main`

### i18n Strategy

The `mkdocs-static-i18n` plugin uses the **suffix** convention: `page.md` = English default, `page.es.md` = Spanish. Internal links in `.es.md` files still point to `.md` filenames — the plugin resolves them to the correct locale automatically.

### Utility Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `make_es_files.py` | Creates/updates `.es.md` files from their English counterparts; handles structural nav-link translations |
| `add_frontmatter.py` | Adds `description:` YAML frontmatter to English docs that lack it |
| `update_image_frontmatter.py` | Injects `image: assets/social-banner.png` into frontmatter of docs missing it |

Run these scripts from the repo root with `python <script>.py` or `uv run python <script>.py`.

## Content Conventions

### All chapters
- Each chapter file starts with YAML frontmatter (`description:`, `image:`)
- Navigation footers use `← [Previous: …]` / `[Next: …] →` links at the bottom of each chapter

### docs/ guide
- 19 chapters + quick reference
- Uses PlanetScale for Postgres (no foreign keys — use `db_constraint=False`)
- All GCP infrastructure defined in Terraform; PlanetScale set up manually via dashboard/CLI

# context-mode — MANDATORY routing rules

You have context-mode MCP tools available. These rules are NOT optional — they protect your context window from flooding. A single unrouted command can dump 56 KB into context and waste the entire session.

## BLOCKED commands — do NOT attempt these

### curl / wget — BLOCKED
Any Bash command containing `curl` or `wget` is intercepted and replaced with an error message. Do NOT retry.
Instead use:
- `ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` to fetch and index web pages
- `ctx_execute(language: "javascript", code: "const r = await fetch(...)")` to run HTTP calls in sandbox

### Inline HTTP — BLOCKED
Any Bash command containing `fetch('http`, `requests.get(`, `requests.post(`, `http.get(`, or `http.request(` is intercepted and replaced with an error message. Do NOT retry with Bash.
Instead use:
- `ctx_execute(language, code)` to run HTTP calls in sandbox — only stdout enters context

### WebFetch — BLOCKED
WebFetch calls are denied entirely. The URL is extracted and you are told to use `ctx_fetch_and_index` instead.
Instead use:
- `ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` then `ctx_search(queries)` to query the indexed content

## REDIRECTED tools — use sandbox equivalents

### Bash (>20 lines output)
Bash is ONLY for: `git`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `mv`, `cd`, `ls`, `npm install`, `pip install`, and other short-output commands.
For everything else, use:
- `ctx_batch_execute(commands, queries)` — run multiple commands + search in ONE call
- `ctx_execute(language: "shell", code: "...")` — run in sandbox, only stdout enters context

### Read (for analysis)
If you are reading a file to **Edit** it → Read is correct (Edit needs content in context).
If you are reading to **analyze, explore, or summarize** → use `ctx_execute_file(path, language, code)` instead. Only your printed summary enters context. The raw file content stays in the sandbox.

### Grep (large results)
Grep results can flood context. Use `ctx_execute(language: "shell", code: "grep ...")` to run searches in sandbox. Only your printed summary enters context.

## Tool selection hierarchy

1. **GATHER**: `ctx_batch_execute(commands, queries)` — Primary tool. Runs all commands, auto-indexes output, returns search results. ONE call replaces 30+ individual calls.
2. **FOLLOW-UP**: `ctx_search(queries: ["q1", "q2", ...])` — Query indexed content. Pass ALL questions as array in ONE call.
3. **PROCESSING**: `ctx_execute(language, code)` | `ctx_execute_file(path, language, code)` — Sandbox execution. Only stdout enters context.
4. **WEB**: `ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` then `ctx_search(queries)` — Fetch, chunk, index, query. Raw HTML never enters context.
5. **INDEX**: `ctx_index(content, source)` — Store content in FTS5 knowledge base for later search.

## Subagent routing

When spawning subagents (Agent/Task tool), the routing block is automatically injected into their prompt. Bash-type subagents are upgraded to general-purpose so they have access to MCP tools. You do NOT need to manually instruct subagents about context-mode.

## Output constraints

- Keep responses under 500 words.
- Write artifacts (code, configs, PRDs) to FILES — never return them as inline text. Return only: file path + 1-line description.
- When indexing content, use descriptive source labels so others can `ctx_search(source: "label")` later.

## ctx commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `ctx stats` | Call the `ctx_stats` MCP tool and display the full output verbatim |
| `ctx doctor` | Call the `ctx_doctor` MCP tool, run the returned shell command, display as checklist |
| `ctx upgrade` | Call the `ctx_upgrade` MCP tool, run the returned shell command, display as checklist |
